# Driver-Interface
## Description
This repository holds the files for the driver interface that we built for the Baja car in Falcon Racing at Seattle Pacific University. We connected a Raspberry Pi 4 to a small display that we put on the dashboard. This display has a fuel gauge, speedometer, and the current gear that the car is in. We ran these Python files on startup of the Raspberry Pi 4 through Crontab and Autostart. This code is still in progress and we will continue to improve upon it. We used the speedometer and current gear functions in the car at the Baja SAE Oregon competition.<br><br>
We used the "Fuel Data 2" database to store data for the fuel flow sensor and hall effect to send data to the display program.
